# Module 2 â€“ Let's Git ðŸ¤“ Part 2 

### This covers the exercise on the day 2 and day 3 after setup 
Tips: use 'git status', 'git log', 'git remote -v', 'git branch -v' to check the status often

## 1. Create a Local Git Repo and Link It to GitHub (Day 2)
Below is an example of creating a local repo called `test_repo` and linking it to GitHub following the day 2 git in-class example

```bash
cd 01_GitHub/test/            # path to work directory
mkdir test_repo
cd test_repo
git init -b main              # Initialize with main as the default branch
touch test.txt; code test.txt # Create test.txt and open it in VS Code
git status
git add test.txt
git status
git log
git commit
git remote add origin https://github.com/yikai82/test_repo.git
git status
git remote -v
```

## 2. Fork a Git Repo from GitHub and Sync to a Local Folder (Day 2)
This is very staight forward, to fork a Git repo, just follow this guide:  
  ðŸ‘‰ [UofT DSI Submission Guide](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md#setting-up)

To clone your forked repo into a local folder:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]               # Clone an existing repository
git clone [repository_url] [new_dir]     # Clone and rename the directory
```

---

## 3. Restore a document from other GitHub Repo (Day 3)
### Background
Someone accidentally delete the avocado from the guacamole recipe, let's fix it. 
Tips: use git status, git remote -v, ls, pwd to 

Follow the command below to create a situation:  

```bash 
cd ~/path/to/work/directory # your work directory
git clone https://github.com/dtxe/dsi_guacamole.git # this will create a folder named 'git_gaucamole' under your working directory
cd ./dsi_guacamole.git
git status
git log # you will see two logs and one of them have a comment "Accidentally delete avocados"
ls # list the file
code guacamole.md 

## Here you will see that avocados was deleted by accident so we want to restore
git switch -c fix-avocados e4912279bfddcc05c9c91924cd40efcf04f2f1c3   # create a new branch 'fix-avocados' to restore the document to its previous time point

# commit id = e4912279bfddcc05c9c91924cd40efcf04f2f1c3
# Use'git log' to retrieve commit id. 

git status

## Fork the dsi_guacamole to your own Git Repo
git remote -v 
git remote rename origin upstream # rename origin to upstream 
git remote add origin https://github.com/yikai82/dsi_guacamole.git  # add new origin 
git remote -v
```

The terminal should have the correct output as below. You will have upstream (point the dtxe) and origin (on your own github):
```bash
origin  https://github.com/yikai82/dsi_guacamole.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/yikai82/dsi_guacamole.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/dtxe/dsi_guacamole.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/dtxe/dsi_guacamole.git (push)
```

Now push the origin to fix-avocados 
```bash
git push -u origin fix-avocados
git push origin main # if your've forked already, you will have a origin main that you can push if needed
```

Open code to edit the guacamole.md to remove `spicy jalapeno pepper or whatever you want to edit`:
```bash
code guacamole.md
git add guacamole.md; git commit
git status; git log                 # to check the status  
git push fix-avocados
```

---

## 4. Merge/Pull other document from Git Repo (Day 3)
### Background 

This is an example from the day 3 git course when a document needs to be pulled/merged from different source (big batch), and how to troubleshoot. Just follow the command in the previous section to setup upstream.  Follow the command below to create a situation. This  

```bash
git pull upstream big-batch # since upstream is setup properly, you can pull the branch 'big batch' directly

```

You will see a warning message from terminal if you are on mac/linux: 

```bash
From https://github.com/dtxe/dsi_guacamole
 * branch            big-batch  -> FETCH_HEAD
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

Run the following command to merge the conflict document and push:

```bash
# I am no sure which one I was using...' '
git pull --no-rebase upsteram main     
git pull --no-rebase

git status # should indicate there is a conflict 
code guacamole.md  
## You will see your change in the <<<<< HEAD 
## You will see an older change in >>>>>> commit id 
## Click the 'Compare Changes' just on the top of code to see the change
## Accept the change and manually edit what you were planning to do in the 
## previous (i.e., remove spicy)  
git add guacamole.md
git commit 
git push 
```

## 5. Cohort7 ---not complete yet
### Background
The instructor was simulating a chaos situation where multiple people working on the same document in an industry setting. 


```bash
## clone the cohort7 playground
git clone https://github.com/simeon-demo/cohort7_playground.git
cd cohort7_playground

## waiting for the invitation as collaborator while you can edit the file you like
ls 
git status; git remove -v
git switch -c [branch.name]
code README.md  # just open and edit whatever you like
git add README.md; git commit

## once you have accepted the invitaion as collaborator, you can start push the change
git push # This will push the local branch along with the edit to the github 
git push README.md upstream main # it might no longer work as if the branch was locked
git pull --no-rebase # to solve any conflict if there is any 
git branch -vv
 
```
### I totally lost here so...

### Save (Stash) Local Work First, Then Sync with GitHub

If youâ€™ve made changes in a local working directory and want to pull updates from GitHub first, the strategy is:

**1. Stash local work**  
**2. Pull from GitHub**  
**3. Reapply local changes**

```bash
cd ./path/to/your/work/directory
git status                # Check current changes
git remote -v             # View origin and upstream paths
git stash                 # Save local changes
# Check your current branch
git switch main           # Switch to main branch if pushing to main
git switch <branch-name>  # Switch to target branch, if not main
git pull origin main      # Pull changes from GitHub
git stash list            # View saved stashes
git stash pop             # Reapply stashed changes
```

### âœ… Proper Way to Switch and Track a Remote Branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch [branch-name]
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/[branch-name]
git push -u origin [branch-name]
```
